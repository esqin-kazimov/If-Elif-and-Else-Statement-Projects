# If-Elif-and-Else-Statement-Projects

The programming constructs that you used to solve the projects in the previous
repositry will continue to be useful as you tackle these problems. In addition, the
projects in this repository will require you to use decision making constructs so that
your programs can handle a variety of different situations that might arise. You should
expect to use some or all of these Python features when completing these problems:

• Make a decision with an if statement

• Select one of two alternatives with an if-else statement

• Select from one of several alternatives by using an if-elif or if-elif-else statement

• Construct a complex condition for an if statement that includes the Boolean operators and, or and not

• Nest an if statement within the body of another if statement
